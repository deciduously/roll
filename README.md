# roll
CLI interface to roll dice.
## Usage
Supply rolls either as args like `roll 1d6` or `roll 2d10 7d83 1d4` or invoke with no arguments for an interactive mode which will evaluate any rolls antered separated by spaces and prompt for further input until a SIGINT.  Eventually I'll write a less sloppy thing.  Maybe.
